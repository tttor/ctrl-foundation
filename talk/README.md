  * we do not learn to drive in a tabula rasa mode
  * You cannot teach humans so easily because they have their own “internal” reward functions that are telling them what to do.
    * This dichotomy between “internal” rewards, which gives us much of our “drive”, and “external” reward that
      society imposes us (parents, teachers, managers etc.),
    * has yet to be reflected in RL research, and yet it is an integral part of how RL works in humans and other animals.
